Cure for 60-100sec bug:

If the number of seconds is 60 or more do the following:
Subtract 60 from the number of seconds.
(68 seconds - 60 seconds = 8 seconds)

Increase the number of minutes by one.
(6 minutes + 1 minute = 7 minutes)

Repeat this process if the number of seconds is still 60 or more.
